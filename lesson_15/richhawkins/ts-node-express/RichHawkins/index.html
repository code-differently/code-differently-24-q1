        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Born in Delaware. I lived in Smyrna until I was 11 and then moved to New Castle. I moved out of my family home when I was 18 and did short stints in Maryland and New Jersey before settling in Pennsylvania for 10 years. After a long hiatus Delaware called me back.</p>

        <p>Currently I'm living in Newark, DE with my wonderful partner of 11 years. I like to spend my free time playing mandolin, guitar, board games, and video games. I'm enrolled in Code Differently, a full stack web development program where I'm learning to code and developing myself professionally. I'm eager to take full advantage of this opportunity and am driven to succeed!</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>2024 is shaping up to be a big year. By August I'll have graduated from Code Differently and be on my way to the tech job I've always wanted. In November I get married. In the future I'm looking forward to buying a house and settling down and can't wait to see where this journey takes me.</p>
