    <h1>ðŸŒ¸ Hello There! ðŸŒ¸</h1>
    <h2>My name is Sherllin Torres and I welcome you to my little bubble ðŸŒ¼</h2>
    <p>I'm currently immersed in the Code Differently Software Engineering training program, gearing up for an exciting journey ahead! My background is a melting pot of diverse experiences. Previously, I've had the privilege of working with individuals with intellectual disabilities, empowering them by connecting them to vital resources. Additionally, I've supported victims of crime, assisting them in navigating the challenging process of reporting crimes and accessing the help they need. In the realm of mental health, I've served as a liaison between patients, primary care providers, and mental health care professionals, ensuring seamless communication and support throughout their journey to wellness. I've also worked in the health tech industry, where I played a pivotal role in educating members about their benefits and how our company could enhance their overall health and well-being. Now, as I venture into the world of software engineering, I'm beyond excited to leverage my past experiences in problem-solving and people skills. I believe that the intersection of technology and human connection holds incredible potential for positive change, and I can't wait to be a part of it. ðŸ§©ðŸ’¡</p>
