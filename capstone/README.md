# Lesson 24

## Capstone Project

For the next two weeks, you and your team will ideate and implement a working software system. You will have the opportunity to apply the skills that you have learned to solve an interesting problem or contribute a meaningful tool that improves our lives.

### Technical Requirements

Your project submission must include the following elements:

* Must have a working front-end that interacts with a back-end web service to retrieve and persist data.
* Your app must be publicly accessible.
* The system must incorporate one third-party API.
* All code must be kept in a public GitHub repository.
* Your repo must include a README with the following elements:
    * The team
    * Screenshot
    * A description of the app
    * Demo link
    * Installation instructions
    * Known issues
    * Roadmap features
    * Credits
* Your team must track issues, bugs, pull requests, and features on GitHub.
* It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you maintain a clean `Main` branch and only merge changes via pull requests (we've been using squashed merges for the main repo to simplify commit history). Don't forget to use [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits-link].

### Important Milestones

To ensure the timely completion of your project, you will need to complete the following milestone tasks.
