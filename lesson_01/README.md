# Lesson 01

## Homework

1. Read CODE 11-12
1. Make HTML version of your previous README.
1. Submit your HTML via a pull request (PR).

## HTML Version of Your README

For this assignment, you are tasked with making a pixel-perfect version of your README file as rendered in GitHub MARKDOWN. You will be assessed by how well your HTML version matches the MARKDOWN version. There are several tools that you can use to complete this assignment, including using LLMs like Chat GPT and Gemini or tools that mimic the markdown-to-html conversion.

I'd highly recommend that you research CSS stylesheets and use them to make your work easier and consistent. If you want to know what styles GitHub uses to render your markdown files, you can use browser debugger tools to inspect the HTML and see what colors, font sizes, and attributes are used for the markdown version.

## Submitting your files

You will use the same process you used in [Lesson 00](/lesson_00/) in order to submit your work. **Please submit your files in a sub-folder created under this folder (lesson_01).** Remember to craft a good pull request (PR) title and description detailing the work you're submitting.
