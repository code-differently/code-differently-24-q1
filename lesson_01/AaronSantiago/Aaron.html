  <h1>Personal README - Aaron Santiago</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hey there! I'm Aaron Santiago, and this is my personal README. Whether you're a colleague, collaborator, or just a curious soul, welcome! This document is a glimpse into what makes working with me a breeze. So, let's dive in!</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> I grew up in the charming state of Delaware, surrounded by technology from a young age. Computers have been my companions since childhood, fueling my passion for coding and all things tech-related.</li>
    <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me indulging in my two great loves - gaming and cooking. From conquering virtual worlds to creating culinary delights, I find joy in these diverse yet equally rewarding pursuits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Communication Preferences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Learning Style:</strong> I thrive on a hands-on approach when tackling new subjects. Practical engagement and experimentation are my go-to methods for absorbing knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> I appreciate feedback that is direct and constructive. If there's something I can improve or do better, a phone call is my preferred mode of communication. It allows for a more nuanced and immediate exchange. However, I'm open to email discussions as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Spare Time Rituals</h2>
  <p>In my precious moments outside of work, I cherish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gaming Escapades:</strong> Whether it's exploring fantastical realms or teaming up for multiplayer adventures, gaming is my ultimate unwind.</li>
    <li><strong>Culinary Ventures:</strong> The kitchen is my canvas. I enjoy experimenting with flavors and crafting delicious meals. Share your favorite recipes, and we'll swap culinary secrets!</li>
    <li><strong>Friendship Conversations:</strong> Nothing beats a good conversation with friends. It could be about the latest gaming strategies, cooking tips, or just life in general. Feel free to join in!</li>
  </ul>
