<h2>My technology journey</h2>
<hr>

<p>As a child I've always been interested in technology. From video games to computers to all various types of media. I've always been drawn towards technology. In the beginning, my passion for technology is a dynamic and multifaceted enthusiasm that permeates various aspects of my life. At the core of this obsession lies a deep love for video games, where the fusion of art and interactive storytelling captivates my imagination.</p>

<p>Beyond gaming, my engagement with technology extends to diverse media forms, as I explore the latest innovations in digital entertainment, from virtual reality experiences to cutting-edge streaming platforms. However, my commitment to technology doesn't stop at consumption; it flourishes in the hands-on realm of building and understanding computer hardware and software. The thrill of assembling components, troubleshooting, and continually expanding my knowledge in this ever-evolving field fuels my drive.</p>

<h2>My Attitude towards life</h2>
<hr>

<p>In short, my general life philosophy is live and let live. I am a fairly individualistic person, and I kinda just wanna do my own thing and vibe out. Very laid back and chill to talk to. However, I'm very organized and goal-oriented. If I'm not getting things done or learning something, I feel like I wasted the day. But I also make time for fun and leisure. I'm a bit reserved in nature, but once you get to know me, I can say and do some pretty crazy things.</p>
