    <h1>Kevin's Read Me</h1>

    <p>Here is a snapshot about me, and my life.</p>

    <h2>Here are some goals that I have!</h2>

    <p>Of course I want to learn coding, but eventually I want to keep developing my skills.
    After I get a high paying job I want to buy multifamily real estate, and then keep building my investment portfolio.
    Keeping on schedule while learning new skills is a challenge for me.
    So one of my goals is to maintain working out, and my fitness regimen while attending this class, and still educating myself when I leave the class.</p>

    <h2>My interests</h2>

    <p>I'm interested in fitness, reading, fashion, and action/drama television shows.
    I'm willing to try new things, and experiences, and I love traveling.
    I love sports basketball, boxing, and football are my favorites.
    I'm a fan of all of the Philly teams mainly the Sixers, and Eagles.</p>

    <h2>Foodie</h2>

    <p>My issue with being a foodie is <strong>fitness</strong>.
    It's so hard being disciplined while also loving so many different kinds of foods.
    So I had to find a happy medium, I do intermittent fasting, sometimes I'll do a 72 hour fast.
    And other days I'll just eat healthy, and eat foods I like either in moderation, or try to make the foods I like in a healthier way.
    Foods I like!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pizza</li>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>steak</li>
        <li>lamb chops</li>
        <li>stir fry</li>
        <li>hot wings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reaching me</h2>

    <p>The best way to reach me is through text, if anyone needs my number you can just ask.
    I rarely check teams after hours, or if we don't have a meeting. </p>

    <h3>Overall</h3>

    <p>I'd say overall I'm really laid back, and easy to get along with.
    I'm a go with the flow type of person, as in I like to see where things are going before I make a decision.
    It's not hard to please me, I can find food at almost any restaurant, and I look for the positives in any situation.
    If I could use one word to describe how I am it would be calm.
    Even though I look calm I may have a million things going on in my head.
    And they say a picture is worth a thousand words so this picture sums me up if I had to choose.

    <h2>That's all Folks</h2>
    <p>Thanks for listening to me! It'll be fun on this new journey that I'm on.
    I'm looking forward to all of the new challenges, and meeting new people.</p>
