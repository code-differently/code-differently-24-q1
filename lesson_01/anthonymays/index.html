    <h1>Anthony D. Mays README</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Single-origin, medium roast coffee from Africa.</li>
        <li>Daily Bible study and prayer</li>
        <li>Jazz / hip-hop fusion with strong piano lines, bass, and drums. Favorite artists right now are <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCK4EdR3o8NrJBhUjy7SXURw?si=a2w82sB5EGXsWAGP">Kiefer</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCdPgDItWooZYAcmdZ33_jEg">Glimlip</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCCCWJwLEvpPAs4r_nJiKe2Q?si=HQFlPrkXSSW3BFlq">Ashley Henry</a>, and <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCCCWJwLEvpPAs4r_nJiKe2Q?si=HQFlPrkXSSW3BFlq">Tom Misch</a>.</li>
        <li>Not operational on Sunday's. That's the Lord's Day so I'm closed for business.</li>
        <li>Smoked meats and BBQ of pretty much any variety (pork, beef, chicken, lamb, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>It's best to get in touch with me after 9am PT on most days. I'm not an early riser.</li>
        <li>I'm instant human, just add coffee.</li>
        <li>There is usually no shortage of things I need to do on any given day as a full-time entrepreneur, so scheduling time with me is usually best. I'm good at ignoring ad-hoc messages.</li>
        <li>Email communication is the best as my inbox is one of the tools I use for priority management. There's a high chance I will miss messages on LinkedIn and Twitter, so don't be afraid to ping me again if I don't respond in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>Before you ask me a question about your tech career, make sure to check my blog at <a href="https://anthonydmays.com/blog">anthonydmays.com/blog</a> to ensure that I haven't already answered it. I also cross post articles on LinkedIn and Medium.</li>
    </ol>
