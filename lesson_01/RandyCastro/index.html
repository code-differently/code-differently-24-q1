<p>Hello, I'm Randy Castro, and for the past six years, I've been deeply immersed in the dynamic world of retail management, specifically at Banana Republic.

<h2>My work hours: 🗓️</h2>

<p>I prefer to kickstart my day with a productive morning routine. Typically, I hit the gym around 7 am to get energized. Then, from 9 am to 5 pm, I focus on tackling my tasks and projects with full dedication and efficiency.</p>

<h2>One of my goals for this year🏆</h2>

<p>My goal is to successfully complete this program and secure a fulfilling career job in the tech industry. I aim to leverage this opportunity and eventually explore other avenues for personal and professional growth.</p>

<h2>Family and Pets</h2>

<p>In my household it is just my wife and our cat name Nori</p>
