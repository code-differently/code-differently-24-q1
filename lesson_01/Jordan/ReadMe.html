    <h1>🌟 Hey There! I'm Jordan Eldridge 🌟</h1>

<u> <h2>Welcome to My Little Corner of the World</h2></u>
    <p>Hey! So glad you stumbled upon my README. Think of this as a backstage pass to the <em>Jordan Eldridge Show</em> - a mix of work, play, and random trivia that makes life fun. I'm all about making connections, sharing laughs, and working smart. So, let's cut the formalities and dive right in, shall we?</p>

    <h3>🎲 A Fun Start: 2 Truths and a Lie</h3>
    <p>First off, let's play a game to break the ice. I'll throw out three facts about myself, but catch this - one of them is a fib. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to sniff out the lie. Ready? Here we go:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Born in the chill vibes of Delaware.</li>
        <li>My family gatherings are a mini festival with 8 siblings.</li>
        <li>Got to be in the arms of the basketball legend, Kobe Bryant.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Okay, drumroll please 🥁... So, the whole Delaware thing? It's only half the story. Born in Ohio, then did my growing-up thing in Darby 
        Township, but high school? That was all Delaware, starting 2010. And yeah, Kobe Bryant holding me is a real deal - pretty wild, right? 
        Plus, toss in 8 siblings to the mix, and you've got my kinda crazy, totally awesome life!</p>

    <h3>The Daily Grind: Work & Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning Person:</strong> I kick off my days with a workout, anytime between 5:30 and 7:30 AM. It's me time before the work frenzy begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Work Hours:</strong> I'm on the clock from 9 AM to about 4:30-5 PM. If I missed my morning workout, I hit the gym in the evening, even though it's like a zoo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📞 Best Ways to Communicate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> Ideal for non-urgent, detailed discussions or when sharing documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Slack:</strong> Perfect for quick questions, updates, or saying hi.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Message:</strong> When immediate attention is needed, a text message is the way to go.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚫 If I Don’t Respond</h2>
    <p>While I strive to be attentive and responsive, there are times when messages might slip through the cracks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Me:</strong> If a prompt response is critical and I haven't answered my phone, please send a text for a quicker reply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🗣 Feedback Preferences</h2>
    <p>Feedback is a gift, and I value it greatly as it contributes to personal and professional growth.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One-on-One Setting:</strong> For feedback, especially personal or sensitive in nature, I prefer face-to-face conversations. It ensures clarity and allows for a more meaningful exchange.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Goals for the Coming Year</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oracle Java Certification:</strong> To deepen my understanding and expertise in Java programming.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Cloud Certification:</strong> To expand my knowledge in cloud computing and services, aligning with the latest industry standards.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Snowboarding Stories:</strong> Slopes, snow, and everything in between.</li>

        <li><strong>Photo Ops:</strong> Peep my photography skills on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordanxeldridge/">Instagram</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🍳 Chef Jordan in the House</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>🐾 Family and Pets</h2>
    <p>Family is everything, and pets make it even better.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Josie:</strong> Our family dog, Josie, is more than a pet; she's the heart of our home, bringing joy and laughter every day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🍕 Food Preferences</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pizza:</strong> A personal pan pizza is my ultimate comfort food. Simple, delicious, and always satisfying.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Darby Township, PA:</strong> It's where my roots are, and it's made me who I am.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏀 Sports Loyalties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sixers:</strong> My basketball team through thick and thin. For football, I enjoy the game more than loyalty to a single team.</li>
    </ul>
