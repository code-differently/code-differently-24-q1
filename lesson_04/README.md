1. Read CC 12.
1. Read article entitled [3 Questions That Will Make You A Phenomenal Rubber Duck][article-link]
1. Complete the [Expression Calculator](#expression-calculator) exercise

## Expression Calculator

For this assignment, you will need to implement the functions and logic required to calculate a mathematical expression. After implementing the `add`, `divide`, and `multiply` functions, you will combine these functions to compute the final result.

1. Update the code in the [ExpressionCalculator.java][calculator-file] file.
2. To check your work, you can run the application using the first command below and run the tests using the second one.
```bash
./gradlew run --console=plain
./gradlew test
```
3. As usual, make sure that you format your code and run the check command before creating your pull request.
```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
./gradlew check
```
4. You must only submit changes to the `ExpressionCalculator.java` file to receive full credit.
