# Spaceship Project

## How does it work?

The goal of this project is to plan two spaceship events, one that succeeds and one that fails:

* Each spaceship event will consist of six different spaceships, ranging from Apollo0 to Apollo6

* The spaceship crew has to be of at least two people as we cannot send someone by themselves, and at most four people to prevent it from going overweight.

* Determined by the size of the crew, the command center will decide whether the spaceship leaves the earth or stays in the ground.

* To run this program, go to SpaceshipTest folder and run CommandCenterTest.java
