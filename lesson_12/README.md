# Lesson 12

## Homework

* Read HFDP 3.
* Complete [Loading the Library](#loading-the-library) assignment.

## Loading The Library

We've got everything we need to manage our library except for one important thingâ€”books! For this assignment, you will need to load data via CSV files by implementing the [LibraryCsvDataLoader][csv-data-loader] class. The files are located in the app's [resources/csv][csv-resources] directory.

To run the app using the default data loader, use the following command (only supports search at the moment):

```java
./gradlew run --console=plain
```

[csv-data-loader]: ./io/io_app/src/main/java/com/codedifferently/lesson12/factory/LibraryCsvDataLoader.java
[csv-resources]: ./io/io_app/src/main/resources/csv/
