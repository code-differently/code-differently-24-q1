# Lesson 20

## Homework

* Watch chapters 1–5, 10, 13, 14 of [CSS Tutorial – Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA)
* Study the template html files and prepare to style it to match the [Code Differently](https://codedifferently.com) website (due by lecture on 4/17).

## Working with CSS Instructions

You will have the opportunity to develop your CSS skills by attempting to mimic a simplified version of the Code Differently website.

1. Make a copy of the template directory and give it a unique name.
2. Add your CSS to the `style.css` file in the directory.
3. Submit a PR with your completed solution. You should only make modifications to the CSS file while leaving the other copies unmodified.

> Make sure that you have the [Live Server](vscode:extension/ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension installed in VS Code for the smoothest development experience.
