        <h>What times are good for working with Me? <br></h>
        <p>-I mostly work 9am â€“ 5pm, the best times to contact me is after 1pm. At the start of the day I like to organize my day into a schedule and check any emails or text related to work as well. As said above the best method to contact me is through email or text message. If needed, you can use my cell to contact me outside of work hours.  <br>-In the case that itâ€™s a quick message or question private message me or find me in person. I would prefer any important information given to me to be given to me in-person, or via email. <br>-As said earlier Iâ€™m more of an afternoon person, any meeting you would like to have please schedule them after 2pm.</p>
