## Hello, World!

Hey there! My name is Adrian, and it's nice to code again (even if this is just markdown). 

### Communication

Email is best for general things, but Slack is best for instant communication. 

### Work (school?) hours

I like to work early, so I start at 8 am and try to end around 5 pm.

### The journey so far

I've spent a lot of time making very basic HTML pages thanks to a little Raspberry Pi 1 and its basic text editor. Since then, I've dabbled in JavaScript to make some small projects. Lately, I've been the especially drawn towards the hardware side of tech. I'm coninuing to upgrade my PC, next is a 4060!

### Goals

* Learn how I learn best! (meta, right?)
* Gain further proficiency with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other languages. 
* Graduate from college with a degree in computer science
* Save up for the RTX 4060 and an MPC 500
* Start my career

### Hobbies

* **Gaming:** My favorite games are Super Smash Brothers (all of them), Overwatch 2, Rocket League, and Fire Emblem: Three Houses. As someone once said, I feel like I spawned into life with a Wii in the house. 
* **Music:** I love listening to music, but I love making it even more. It all truly began with the Yamaha Mox-F8, which has recording capabilities. I used that keyboard as my primary Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for 8? years or so. Finally, I bought and upgraded a FL Studio license, and it's stuck with me ever since! I make Lofi-Chillhop, Breakcore, House, Phonk, and a variety of other genres. 
* **PC Building:** I've not been able to build from the ground up, but my first experience building at all was phenomenal. I can't wait to do it again. When I'm not building, I'm always researching parts to get or new technologies that will accelerate the PC space. 
* **Reading:** The Star Wars books from the 90s-2000s never get old. I also love history texts, particularly regarding church history, philosophy, and WWII. I'm also slowly but surely building up my manga collection with Fullmetal Alchemist, Dragon Ball, and Naruto. 
* **Movies/Shows:** Some favorites are Tenant, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, most Star Wars movies (seven and nine are disqualified), Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Saving Private Ryan. There are many more!


### Speed Round!
* Hot over cold weather. 
* Cake over ice cream. 
* Coffee Order: Preferably an espresso or Mexican mocha. 
* I do karate!
* Favorite Marvel Hero:
