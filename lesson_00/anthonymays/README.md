# Anthony D. Mays README

## Introduction

Anthony is a software engineer with over 20 years of industry experience and a former foster kid from Compton. He has worked for companies including City National Bank, Slalom Consulting, and most recently, Google. Currently the full-time founder of Morgan Latimer Consulting, Anthony is dedicated to providing the next generation of technologists with tools that will help them thrive in their career.

## Prerequisites

Here are some of the things I need to be a productive citizen and engineer.

* Single-origin, medium roast coffee from Africa.
* Daily Bible study and prayer
* Jazz / hip-hop fusion with strong piano lines, bass, and drums. Favorite artists right now are [Kiefer][kiefer-link], [Glimlip][glimlip-link], [Ashley Henry][ashley-henry-link], and [Tom Misch][tom-misch-link].
* Not operational on Sunday's. That's the Lord's Day so I'm closed for business.
* Smoked meats and BBQ of pretty much any variety (pork, beef, chicken, lamb, etc.).

## Installation Instructions

1. It's best to get in touch with me after 9am PT on most days. I'm not an early riser.
1. I'm instant human, just add coffee.
1. There is usually no shortage of things I need to do on any given day as a full-time entrepreneur, so scheduling time with me is usually best. I'm good at ignoring ad-hoc messages.
1. Email communication is the best as my inbox is one of the tools I use for priority management. There's a high chance I will miss messages on LinkedIn and Twitter, so don't be afraid to ping me again if I don't respond in a timely manner.
1. Before you ask me a question about your tech career, make sure to check my blog at [anthonydmays.com/blog](https://anthonydmays.com/blog) to ensure that I haven't already answered it. I also cross post articles on LinkedIn and Medium.

## Support

* You can find me on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and my website at anthonydmays.com if you want to reach out. If you need help with career and interview prep, book a free consultation with me at morganlatimer.com.

## Fun Facts

* I've been playing the piano since I was 7 years old (my other keyboard is a Yamaha!).
* My first programming language was BASIC, which I learned at the age of 8.
* A viral [BuzzFeed documentary][buzzfeed-link] about my journey from Compton to Google was published in 2018.
* I am a licensed minister in the State of California.
