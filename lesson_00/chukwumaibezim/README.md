Hello there! I'm Chukwuma Ibezim, hailing from the vibrant city of Brooklyn. With a background in financial services, particularly at Capital One, I've always been fascinated by the intricacies of the financial world. My roots trace back to Nigeria, blending seamlessly with my African American identity, shaping a unique cultural perspective.

## Interests
When I'm not crunching numbers or diving into financial analyses, you'll often find me indulging in my favorite TV shows. I'm a big fan of gripping dramas like *Power*, *Snowfall*, and *Game of Thrones*, as well as legal dramas like *Suits*, *Chicago PD*, and *Law and Order: SVU*. These shows not only entertain but also offer intriguing insights into human behavior and societal dynamics.

Traveling is another passion of mine. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and savoring diverse cuisines is truly enriching.

## Dreams and Aspirations
While my childhood dream of becoming a lawyer ignited a passion for justice and advocacy, my career journey has led me down an exciting path towards the world of technology. Transitioning from the legal realm, I found myself drawn to the dynamic field of software engineering.

Exploring the realms of coding, I have dabbled in various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript, and Spring Boot. The challenge of problem-solving, the thrill of creating innovative solutions, and the ever-evolving nature of technology have captivated my interest and fueled my aspirations in this domain.

As a software engineer, my goal is to leverage my diverse skill set and background in financial services to develop cutting-edge applications, streamline processes, and drive impactful change in the digital landscape. I am committed to continuous learning, growth, and making meaningful contributions to the tech community.

## Learning Style
When it comes to learning, I prefer a hands-on approach combined with visual aids. I find that watching instructional videos and engaging in practical, hands-on activities help me grasp concepts more effectively. This approach allows me to visualize complex ideas and immediately apply them in real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding and retention of the material.
