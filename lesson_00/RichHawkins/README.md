# 💰👑 Hello, my name is Rich Hawkins 👑💰
Welcome to my README. Here you will learn a little more about where I'm from and where I'm going    
## 🚫💵 Where I was.
Born in Delaware. I lived in Smyrna until I was 11 and then moved to New Castle. I moved out of my family home when I was 18 and did short stints in Maryland and New Jersey before settling in Pennsylvania for 10 years. After a long hiatus Delaware called me back.

Currently I'm living in Newark, DE with my wonderful partner of 11 years. I like to spend my free time playing mandolin, guitar, board games, and video games. I'm enrolled in Code Differently, a full stack web development program where I'm learning to code and developing myself professionally. I'm eager to take full advantage of this opportunity and am driven to succeed!

## 💸💸 Where I am going.
2024 is shaping up to be a big year. By August I'll have graduated from Code Differently and be on my way to the tech job I've always wanted. In November I get married. In the future I'm looking forward to buying a house and settling down and can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
  
## 📖 More About Nothing.
**📱Preferred Communication:** I believe in open and honest communication! I believe its a two way street for good communication. Text or email, if you call me be prepared to leave a voice mail message.

**Things I enjoy:**

  - **🎵 Music:** I love most genres of music and play 2 instruments, mandolin and guitar. 🎸
  - **🏈 Football:** Lifelong Eagles fan. Go Birds!! 🦅
  - **🖥️ Computers:** Building PC's has been a hobby of mine since I was a teenager. ⌨️
  - **🍳 Cooking:** Early on in life I was a linecook for a few years and that created a passion for cooking and trying new cuisines. 🍟
  - **🎲 Boardgames:** The more complex the better. Love to sit with friends for a few hours problem solving while competing. 🎲
