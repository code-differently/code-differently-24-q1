## Introduction
Hey there! I'm Aaron Santiago, and this is my personal README. Whether you're a colleague, collaborator, or just a curious soul, welcome! This document is a glimpse into what makes working with me a breeze. So, let's dive in!

## About Me
- **Background:** I grew up in the charming state of Delaware, surrounded by technology from a young age. Computers have been my companions since childhood, fueling my passion for coding and all things tech-related.
- **Hobbies:** When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me indulging in my two great loves - gaming and cooking. From conquering virtual worlds to creating culinary delights, I find joy in these diverse yet equally rewarding pursuits.

## Communication Preferences
- **Learning Style:** I thrive on a hands-on approach when tackling new subjects. Practical engagement and experimentation are my go-to methods for absorbing knowledge.
- **Feedback:** I appreciate feedback that is direct and constructive. If there's something I can improve or do better, a phone call is my preferred mode of communication. It allows for a more nuanced and immediate exchange. However, I'm open to email discussions as well.

## Spare Time Rituals
In my precious moments outside of work, I cherish:
- **Gaming Escapades:** Whether it's exploring fantastical realms or teaming up for multiplayer adventures, gaming is my ultimate unwind.
- **Culinary Ventures:** The kitchen is my canvas. I enjoy experimenting with flavors and crafting delicious meals. Share your favorite recipes, and we'll swap culinary secrets!
- **Friendship Conversations:** Nothing beats a good conversation with friends. It could be about the latest gaming strategies, cooking tips, or just life in general. Feel free to join in!
