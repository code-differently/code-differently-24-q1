# Kevin-s_Read_me

Here is a snapshot about me, and my life.

## here are some goals that I have!

Of course I want to learn coding, but eventually I want to keep developing my kills.
After I get a high paying job I want to buy multifamily real estate, and then keep buiding my investment portfolio.
Keeping on schedule while learning new skills is a challenge for me.
So one of my goals is to maintain working out, and my fitness regimine while attending this class, and still educating myself when I leave the class.

## My interests

I'm interested in fitness, reading, fashion, and action/drama television shows.
I'm willing to try new things, and experiences, and I love traveling.
I love sports basketball, boxing, and football are my favorites.
I'm a fan of all of the philly teams mainly the sixers, and eagles.

### Foodie

My issue with being a foodie is **fitness**.
it's so hard being disciplined while also loving so many different kind of foods.
So I had to find a happy medium, I do intermittent fasting, sometimes I'll do a 72 hour fast.
And other days I'll just eat healthy, and eat foods I like either in moderation, or try to make the foods I like in a healthier way.
Foods I like!
- pizza
- pasta
- steak
- lamb chops
- stir fry
- hot wings

## Reaching me
The best way to reach me is through text, if anyone needs my number you can just ask.
I rarely check teams after hours, or if we don't have a meeting. 






### Overall

I'd say overall I'm really laid back, and easy to get along with.
I'm a go with the flow type of person, as in a like to see where things are going before I make a decision.
It's not hard to please me, I can find food at almost any restaurant, and I look for the positives in any situation.
If I could use one word to describe how I am it would be calm.
Even though I look calm I may have a million things going on in my head.
And they say a picture is worth a thousand words so this picture sums me up if I had to choose. ![alt text](https://media1.tenor.com/m/oUYTP-tyBl0AAAAC/lion-king-hakuna-matata.gif)

## That's all Folks
Thanks for listening to me! It'll be fun on this new journey that I'm on.
I'm looking forward to all of the new challenges, and meeting new people.
