# Greetings 🌸 I'm Nataya Price 

## What can you find me doing? ⭐
I’m a visual artist and a creative concepts director and producer, a visionary who thrives on turning ideas into reality. Apart from creating beautiful nail sculptures and mastering the art of nail design, I've even ventured into the world of publishing with my own photo book. I also find joy in the simple things, like sitting down to reflect and letting my thoughts wander. Whenever I tackle a project, my motto is to do it 10 times better than before—I thrive on continuous improvement. I love learning and discovering new things every day. I believe in soaking up every bit of knowledge and enjoying every moment. I'm all about challenges, be it in my work or personal growth. The beauty of collaboration and forming connections organically is what keeps my creative juices flowing. 

## My Work Hours 💻
I tend to favor mornings. I like to get my day started early. 

## Things I Enjoy 💌
* Self-care rituals—indulging in skincare, haircare, and nails. 
* Working on meticulous projects like intricate nail designs, hairstyling, and sewing 
* Summer time/warm weather
* Reveling in the joy of research 
* Being out in nature 
* Spending quality time with family and friends 

## One of My Goals 🌐

This year, my goal is to travel abroad, and one destination that I have in mind is St. Lucia. Exploring new countries has always intrigued me, and I'm particularly excited about the prospect of visiting the beautiful landscapes and vibrant culture of St. Lucia.

## Favorite Book Genres ⭐
A passionate reader, I explore diverse genres, from science fiction and Afro-futurism to mystery and period pieces. My reading journey is a continuous exploration. Currently immersed in Octavia Butler's "Lilith's Brood."
